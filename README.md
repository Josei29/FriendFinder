## Home Page
This is the home page of the application and as you can see the URL is http://localhost:3000 wich means that the app is online running with the Express server we created. It has 3 buttons, Find Someone will take you to a new HTML document where you will be able to fill a form and answer some questions! With the Api Friends List you will be able to see the current list of friends the server has.
